# Space-Shooter-browser-game

This is a simple browser game that I made as an exercise in DOM manipulation.

To play the game:
  - Open the index.html file.
  - Click the start button.
  - Move the ship up and down with the up and down arrow keys.
  - fire the laser with the space bar.
  
  The game can be played here:
